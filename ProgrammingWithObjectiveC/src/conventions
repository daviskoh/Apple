*************** Conventions *****************

Prefixes:

Class Should Use 3 Letter Prefixes to Avoid Name Clash
- 2 letter prefixes reserved for Apple

Add prefixes to category methods

Camel Cases Prefered


Getters & Setters:
- if using getters, they should be named same as the property
- exception for ones that return booleans: these should prefix w/ "is"
ex: isPaused for property paused
- setters should use prefix "set"
ex: setFirstName for firstName
